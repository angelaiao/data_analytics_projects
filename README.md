## Mini SQL Projects
A series of mini SQL projects completed on Datacamp.

### Analyzing Students' Mental Health with SQL
This project delves into the mental health of international students at a Japanese university, using a dataset from a 2018 survey. Students face a higher risk of mental health difficulties compared to the general population. Using PostgreSQL, I explore the data and look into whether whether the length of stay in the country correlates with mental healh outcomes such as depression.
